## Sharing my expertise as a conference speaker and mentor

I know how hard it is to continuously learn and improve yourself while living a meaningful life outside work.

Started sharing knowledge in the conference circuit brought me new friends and a lot of inner value. Soon after I started mentoring junior engineers remotely for a career path that fulfills them.

Brought hands-on workshops to companies to solve their ever-growing learning needs.
