Quite a few years have passed since I switched countries and returned to the Netherlands. I was focused on getting my child settled properly, navigating through the real estate crowded and complex landscape, and focusing on my corporate job.

As a consequence, quite a few things have slipped under the radar, and writing technical pieces is the most prominent one.

2023 marks my attempt at a comeback, since I love sharing my learnings and expertise for all to benefit.
