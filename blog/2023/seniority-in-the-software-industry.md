For a few years now I've been regularly conducting interviews for my current employer. 
Prior to that I was finding collaborators for projects of my own company, when the workload 
was too much to handle with my own employees, or when extremely specialised help was needed.
Over my entire career I've been involved in the recruiting process, from both sides of the table.
